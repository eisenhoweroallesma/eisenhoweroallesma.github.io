<img class="img-fluid" src="../">

I joined the archery club at the start of my freshman year because I wanted to get involved in school activities. Archery was perfect for me because shooting with bows and arrows felt cool and it's not really much of a physical sport.

During my freshmen year, I did not start off great. The club would practice for the whole school year until the end of May for the tournament against other schools in Hawaii. Unfortunately, I came in second to last place. But I promised myself to do better next year.

And so I did, in my sophomore year, I got better. I practiced many hours after school and I found many different techniques for me to shoot accurate with my arrows. That tournament put me in 5th place. I was even more motivated to do better next year.

I had so much confidence that I felt I was going to be in 1st place. Until the upcoming tournament came and it got cancelled due to the Covid-19.
