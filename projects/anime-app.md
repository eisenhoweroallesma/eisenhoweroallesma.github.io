I've taken AP Computer Science in high school and one of the project apps that I made was an Anime Recommendation app. Basically, this app asks you two questions and it will recommend you the app based on your selection. Somewhat similar to Crunchyroll except my version.

For example, the first question asks you what type of genre are you interested in. There are variety of genres such as romcom, isekai, slice of life, shonen, etc. Then the next question will ask you how many episodes
are you thinking of watching. From this program, it is linked to so many lists of anime that can suit to whatever the user wants to watch and with the information it receives, it will break down and it will output a recommended anime.

I was very proud of this project. I made this app during my senior year in high school.
