I think building my own PC was like a new chapter into my life for me. The reason is that it wasn't just for fun or wanting to own a PC, but it felt like since I'm going to find a career in the technology field, it would be best for me to build my own computer to have the experience. I had these thoughts when I was in highschool, and in highschool, I took electives such as cybersecurity and networking. I knew that if, I were to major something in computers, I would have to know about how computers work. It was a great decision for me to make this choice.

When I graduated highschool, my older brother asked me what I wanted, and my first thought was getting a computer. I told him that I wanted to build the computer parts by parts. It was way more expensive than having a prebuilt PC, but it was worth it. My purchases included two monitors, a tower with a GPU, a motherboard, SSD, CPU, a cooler, fans, and a power supply. By the time I got home, I started building. At first, I didn't know what I was doing. So I called a friend to help me during call. He helped me most through the working. It took about 8 hours to finish building it. It took even more hours to turn it on because there were some commands that we had to set up. Throughout the years, I got used to knowing how the cables and how to start up my computer.I bought new and better parts to make my PC even better. Then I started building another PC just for fun for my older brother. This was my whole journey to building a PC.
