To celebrate my graduation for my high school diploma, I asked my older brother to buy me all the parts in building a PC. If I want to take technology seriously in the future, especially if it benefits my degree and career, I figured that building my own PC was a great start.

With the help of a great friend, I was able to build my own PC in 8 hours. It took longer than expected but I started to figure out how all the cables and plugs work. Then after, I started learn some of the commands on the computer like the advance boot options.
