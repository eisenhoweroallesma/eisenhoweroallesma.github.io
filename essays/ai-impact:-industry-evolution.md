### I. Introduction
The rise and impact of AI or Artificial Intelligence has revolutionized the current state of the world. Its movement since 2022 has popularized the internet for reshaping the learning process, enhancing technology, and enabling fathomless insight into using tools across all open sources of the internet. Given this topic, I want to share my experience through the semester of ICS 314 and how it helped me view the aspects of using AI.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18: At the beginning of the semester, I did not use ChatGPT because I had knowledge from previous classes that I used to do in these WODs. But as soon as the assignments got harder, it was difficult for me to understand my mistakes and I had to use ChatGPT. I used no other than ChatGPT because that is the only AI website that I know of.
Initially, I did not use ChatGPT atbecause I had done these assignments previously in previous classes. But as soon as the assignments got harder, it was difficult for me to understand my mistakes, and I had to use ChatGPT. My only experience with AI is through ChatGPT since it's the only AI website I know.
