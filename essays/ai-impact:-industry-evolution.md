### I. Introduction
The rise and impact of AI or Artificial Intelligence has revolutionized the current state of the world. Its movement since 2022 has popularized the internet for reshaping the learning process, enhancing technology, and enabling fathomless insight into using tools across all open sources of the internet. Given this topic, I want to share my experience through the semester of ICS 314 and how it helped me view the aspects of using AI.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18: At the beginning of the semester, I didn't use any AI or open-source intelligence websites because I already knew how to do some of the WODs from previous classes. But as soon as the assignments got harder, it was difficult for me to understand my mistakes, and I had to use ChatGPT. I've only used ChatGPT throughout the whole semester.
    
  2. In-class Practice WODs: I used ChatGPT for some in-class practice WODs, but there were some that I didn't have to because there were assignments that were very similar to the WODs. I took this opportunity as an advantage to prepare what to expect for the real WODs on the upcoming day.
