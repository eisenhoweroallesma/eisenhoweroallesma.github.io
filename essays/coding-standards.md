## Experiencing IntelliJ and ESLint for the first time

It was not a great first experience for me when I used IntelliJ and ESLint. And the reason for that is I didn't turn in the assignment when we first used IntelliJ and ESLint. It was all new to me and I couldn't figure out the tools in the system. When I first heard that we were going to use these tools and applications, I felt like I was screwed. This was going to be the downfall of my grades and my degree. I felt like the part that screwed me up was the plug-ins because I only enabled the ones I thought we need, as said in the instructions. There were some plug-ins that were needed such as the terminal. So I didn't want to screw up anymore and I enabled everything just in case. Students in the Discord group chat were telling me to install Volta, which was never said in the instructions. Commands were saying they were not found and I was stressing. When I went to my in-person class, they were saying that we didn't need to install Volta and that we just needed to put "npm install." I guess I shouldn't listen to students who aren't in our section. It was really not a great start for me.

The next assignment of that week was almost the same task as the last assignment. I wanted to try again because if we're gonna use this tool for the rest of the semester, I have to learn how to use it. Because I enabled all the plug-ins and some things started working, especially the "npm install," it was working smoothly and I started to understand how to use the tools. I understood why IntelliJ was a great choice to use for Github. I believed it was easier and it did make it look like I was programming professionally. As for the ESLint, the green checkmarks did make me feel paranoid at first, but I started to understand what the coding standards want. I felt like each time we did a WOD and I believe this is our 4th time using these tools, it was getting easier to use.

## Changes in my life

This is the path that will guide me towards my goal. As I aim for a career in computer science, it brings value to me that it helps expand my knowledge on coding standards and more programming languages. Learning to use IntelliJ and ESLint, I can tell that they will be a great use in the future. It takes a few tries but I learn to adapt and fix my mistakes. It takes practices to learning something new.
