Learning UI frameworks for the first time was a whole new direction for me after we did many assignments on JavaScript. It wasn’t too complicated or confusing. It was more that I started to enjoy learning how to use it because we were getting started on making web pages. I know it was something that could really benefit me in the future. The programming language was for me.

The only framework I used was the one in class, Bootstrap 5. We used raw HTML and CSS. I don’t think it’s necessary for me to use any other frameworks in class unless I have to. Pretty much the codes were all in "<>" and lots of hitting the tabs button to organize the coding. I did use ChatGPT to help me set up buttons and headings for the web pages. I was frustrated a lot mainly alignment.

UI frameworks benefit software engineers, as well as other careers such as web developers and designers. Bootstrap, it's like the powerhouse of the internet in order to create web applications. In the future, this can help many students in the world to create many designs online. Many web applications to their own idea. I know for a fact that someday, I will create a web page of my own.
