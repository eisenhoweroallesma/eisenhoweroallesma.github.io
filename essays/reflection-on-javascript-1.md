## Experience with Javascript

I think that what I’m learning in Javascript is fun for now. I’m learning some new lines that I haven’t used before and I feel like it’s easier for me to use. I’m not sure if it's the same program language but in another Java or Javascript, we would use print.ln instead of console.log. It works the same thing but at least I’m learning something new. Out of all the programming languages that I have done, Java is the easiest to code with. I have more experience with Java before such as taking ICS 111 and 211 and also computer science in high school. 

## Practicing with WODs

From what I searched about athletic software engineering, I feel that athletic software engineering is the right educational goal. I find practice WODs very useful but at the same time, pressuring because there are time limits. These time limits are set too low because they want us to complete projects or tasks faster. I have no complaints about this because it is effective. I feel that this style of writing can benefit me because the more time we practice, the better we get and how much we can achieve if we can solve problems faster in the future when we improve every day. I wouldn’t say enjoyable but I would say that it helps me.

## Lesson and Improvement

From my own experience, I wasn’t sure if the professor was serious about time management because he wanted us to focus more hours on our classwork every day. But now I am sure that I would put in the effort to try my best to put in more hours in our classwork because this is important to me and my major and as well of course, my future. It is not just learning how to use program languages and code faster, but also getting better at how we can make our personas more professional, which I am glad that we are learning to do.
