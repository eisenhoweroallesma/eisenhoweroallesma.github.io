## Keeping faith in my career choices

My interest in computer science started in junior year of my high school. I didn't really think much about what I wanted to do in college. I thought that if I could pick a random major, I would stick with it.
One of my teachers who taught Analytical Trigonemty and Computer Science recommended me to take her class and I might as well because I needed to fill out electives in my registration paper.
The class started as fun because we get to experience the types of games made by programming. And it was interesting to me that in the middle of the semester, we would make games ourselves.
I enjoyed the class so much that I wanted to take AP for it. It was a bit hard but I pulled through. Yet my interest still remains in learning in computer science. But at the same time, I was taking cybersecurity classes and networking. It was hard for me to decide what major I want in college because I took many different computer classes. I kept switch degrees from the cybersecurity path to computer science and I stood with it.
I've gotten this far with so many knowledge about different types of programming languages so why would I throw it all away?

## Getting to know software engineering

I don't know exactly know the difference between software engineering and computer science, but all I know is I'm taking this class (ICS 314). The idea is different than what I've taken in classes before because it feels serious like I'm getting closer to getting a career. I've only taken this class for 2 weeks now and so far, it is difficult. There are so many to explore in this class and I'm hoping that this opens up a few doors for me to take opportunities in what I can. I'm interested in the part that software engineering expands more on computer science.

## Potential in skills and experience

From what I gathered from my professor, the main skill I want to develop is getting better at communicating and learning to get myself out there because I believe I can get so many good jobs if I put in the potential. The experience is what I need to work on the most because this major takes a lot on experiences and projects. I hope that my professional portfolio gets out there and I'll do my best to take this class seriosuly and put in my 100% effort.
